Resources for getting started with the original Ender 3 3D Printer

## Assembly & Getting Started

**Assembly**

- Expect to take 45 minutes to 2 hours for assembly, depending on experience

- Watch this video before and/or during assembly - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me8Qrwh907Q

**Bed Leveling**

- Before your first print, leveling your bed is a crucial step to successful printing. This is how close/far your nozzle is to the build surface, and how consistent that distance is across the X and Y axes.

- Sometimes your aluminum carriage can be very slightly bent, usually this will cause the middle, along the Y-axis to be higher or lower than the left and right X-axis edges.

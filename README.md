# Creality Ender 3 - 3D Printing Getting Started Guide

Resources for getting started with the original Ender 3 3D Printer

## Assembly & Getting Started

**Assembly**

- Expect to take 45 minutes to 2 hours for assembly, depending on experience

- Watch this video before and/or during assembly - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me8Qrwh907Q

**Bed Leveling**

- Before your first print, leveling your bed is a crucial step to successful printing. This is how close/far your nozzle is to the build surface, and how consistent that distance is across the X and Y axes.

- In the assembly video above, he mentions cutting off the z-limit switch plastic stop so that it can be mounted slightly lower. This is a common need to d0. So when you first home your nozzle, if it's very far (3mm+) from the build surface, you may need to do the same. Clip off the plastic nub with your flush cuts, and mount a little lower.

- Sometimes your aluminum carriage can be very slightly bent, usually this will cause the middle, along the Y-axis to be higher or lower than the left and right X-axis edges.

## Printable / DIY Upgrades

- Main Board Fan Cover (**HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**) - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2935204

- LCD PCB Cover (**HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**) - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2858209

- Ender 3 Cable Chain - a chained cable is a safe cable! - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2920060

- Display Ribbon Cable Clips, print 2 - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2880021

- Extruder Knob - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3176144

- Sharpen the spatula that comes with the kit on a belt sander, also round-over the sharp corner edges, they tend to easily gouge your bed otherwise. **CAUTION!** NEVER USE THE SPATULA IN A DIRECTION TOWARD YOUR ARM OR HAND!

## Buyable Upgrades

- New motherboard - https://www.amazon.com/Creality-Original-Motherboard-TMC2208-Stepper/dp/B07TCFQ816 - will help greatly in quieting your machine down and comes with a boot-loader and thermal-runaway preinstalled.

- Capricorn PTFE Tubing - improves quality, longer life than stock PTFE, can withstand high temps for high-temp filaments. (**HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**) - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079P92HN9/

- Creality Ender 3 Tempered Glass Bed Build Surface - https://www.amazon.com/Creality-Upgraded-Platform-Tempered-235x235x4mm/dp/B07QYFYX8D - I really dislike the stock surface and much prefer this. Though also magnetic/flexible surfaces are available and might be what you want too.

## 3D Printing Tools and Accessories

## Software

**Slicer**

- Install the latest version of Ultimaker Cura (currently 4.1) - https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura

- Then follow the instructions to install Creawsome Mod for Cura - https://github.com/trouch/CreawsomeMod - the default Ender 3 settings are a really great starting point to get up and running quickly!
  - General instalation instructions:
    - Run Cura at least once before installing the mod.
    - Download the Creawsome mod from the link in the readme.md (not the github zip)
    - Replace your Cura "resources" folder with the Creawsome resources folder.
    - Run Cura (you should see a splash screen with Creawsome in the name)
    - Set up your Printer using the Creawsome presets.

**Design**

- Tinkercad is a great starting point, free and easy! - https://www.tinkercad.com

- Sketchup 3D

- Fusion 360

## Filament

**PLA**

- Prusament is top-notch

- Hatchbox

- 3D Solutech

- Zyltech

- eSun

- Any 1kg spool under \$15 is a good deal, but be aware that some brands make terrible filament; research accordingly!

## General Tips & Tricks

- You can print via a USB cable tethered to your computer, but I don't recommend it, because CPU strain on the computer can cause the machine to slow down or pause intermittently. Instead opt to use the micro SD card.

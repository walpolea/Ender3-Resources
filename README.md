**Bed Leveling**

- Before your first print, leveling your bed is a crucial step to successful printing. This is how close/far your nozzle is to the build surface, and how consistent that distance is across the X and Y axes.

- Sometimes your aluminum carriage can be very slightly bent, usually this will cause the middle, along the Y-axis to be higher or lower than the left and right X-axis edges.
